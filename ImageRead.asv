% 1. (a) Write a function that reads in an image and displays it so that 1%
% of the pixels are black and 1% of the pixels are white. Hint: your
% function can call the stretchlim function, see the help for that function.

function [img] = ImageRead(inputs)
    img = imread(inputs);
    %img = imshow(img,[]);
    low_high = stretchlim(img)
    dispimg = 




end
